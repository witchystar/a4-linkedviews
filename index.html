  <h2>Boxes Shipped vs. Sales Amount</h2>
  <p>
    This scatterplot maps <strong>Boxes Shipped</strong> against <strong>Amount</strong> to reveal the relationship 
    between volume and revenue for individual sales entries. Use the interactive brush (click and drag) 
    to select a specific subset of data points. Selected points will turn orange to provide 
    immediate visual confirmation.

  <h2>Total Sales by Country</h2>
  <p>
    This bar chart aggregates the total sales <strong>Amount</strong> by <strong>Country</strong>. 
    It is dynamically linked to the scatterplot above; as you adjust your brush selection, this chart 
    instantly updates to reflect the totals for only the specific transactions you have highlighted.
